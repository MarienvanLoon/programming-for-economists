Installing the software
=======================


.. _install:

*Disclaimer*: below we describe the software that you need to
install for this course. Although we are not aware of any problems with these
programs, we cannot accept responsibility in case anything goes wrong
with your computer. Also, when you use this software, make sure
to save regularly and back up your work.

We need to install quite some software. This will be a bit of work and
things are bound to go wrong. So switch on some music_ and go ahead!

This is the first hurdle that you need to take to use open source
software. If you get an error message during installation, copy the
error message and google it. In 99 percent of the cases this will
solve your problem. If not; ask us in class.




Required installs for this course:
----------------------------------

* As we will be working with GitHub_, we need to install Git_. No need
  to install a fancy GUI, as we will be working with the command line.

  * if you need more help here,
	`<http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_
	may be useful and
	`<http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup>`_.

* Windows has a command-prompt_ installed by default. It is probably
  not the best terminal you can use. Here is a discussion of better
  consoles_ for windows. Note that the last link points to
  stackoverflow_; a website that you will be visiting a lot in the
  coming weeks!
* If you have a Mac, the application you need is called Terminal. But
  you may want to install iTerm2_, as it is more fancy and easier to
  work with.
* The program language that we use for this course is python_ which we
  will use with the ipython_ or `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ notebook interface. You can install these
  things separately, but it is easier to install everything
  together. The best way to do this is to use the anaconda_
  distribution. Make sure to install python 3.0. See the
  quantitative_ economics website on how to install anaconda. If for
  some reason you cannot get anaconda installed, ask us in class and
  we will help.
* todo: install R
* todo: R for the notebook
  
If you have installed all this: congratulations, you are done! If you experienced any problems, ask us in class. Below we give some software resources, that you can install; but you do not have to do this.
