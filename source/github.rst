Github
======

We teach you to program in python and R and to explain your code using markdown. For us (and others) to see what you have done, you should publish the jupyter notebooks that you have worked on. For this course, we use github for you to publish your results.

Github is an extremely powerful tool as it allows for team collaboration and version control in the cloud. Further, it allows you to publish webpages in html. In fact, the documentation for this course is on github (as you can see in the html address).

However, you do not need to know all this for the purpose of this course. We will only use github for you to put your jupyter notebooks on line so that we can grade them.

register
--------

In order to use github, you need to register.


repository

Make a repository "programming_assignments".

The address of this repository in webform at ???

Webform asks for:

* github account name
* html address of your repository "programming_assignments"
* DataCamp account name
* your ANR
* your uvt-email address

  
The readme file in the "programming_assignments" repository contains a link to each assignment. Hence, after you have uploaded an assignment, adjust the readme file to include the html address of the jupyter notebook that you have just uploaded.

todo: add video on how files are put on github
