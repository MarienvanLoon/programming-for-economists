Markdown in the notebook
========================




We teach you to program python and R in the jupyter notebook. However, for other
people to understand what you are doing, it is important that you explain each
step in text that is readable to other human beings, even ones that have no
programming experience. Consider yourself working for a consultancy firm after
finishing your studies. Your boss asks you to solve a problem and you find a way
to program the solution to this problem. To convince your boss that you found
the correct solution, she needs to understand what you did --even if she cannot
program in python or R herself. For this we use markdown which is a simple
"language" to typeset text. Using this language you can explain each step in
your jupyter notebook.

You need markdown to create a README file on your github page which contains the
links to your assignments. For an example of such a README file, see `this file
on github. <https://github.com/janboone/assignments/blob/master/README.md>`_
Click on the `Raw` button to see the markdown used to create the links.

For this example, the github link that you post in the google-form is this one: `<https://github.com/janboone/assignments>`_
When we click on this link, we immediately see your README file with the links
to your assignments. Note that for this course, there is no need to create a CV.
