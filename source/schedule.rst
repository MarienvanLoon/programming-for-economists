This page gives the schedule for the course. Make sure that you
prepare for each week's lecture and/or tutorial the topics that are
mentioned for this week. To illustrate, for the first week, go to the
:ref:`install page <install>` and follow instructions there and go to
the `datacamp website
<https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science>`_
and go through chapter 1 Python Basics. That is, watch the videos and
do the exercises on line. Note that we get feedback from Datacamp on whether or
not you actually did the exercises and we will grade this using a Pass/Fail
grade (see below).
