This page gives the schedule for the course. Make sure that you
prepare for each week's lecture and/or tutorial the topics that are
mentioned for this week. To illustrate, for the first week, go to the
:ref:`install page <install>` and follow instructions there and go to
the `datacamp website
<https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science>`_
and go through chapter 1 Python Basics. That is, watch the videos and
do the exercises on line. Note that we get feedback from Datacamp on whether or
