Rules of the game
=================


Datacamp
~~~~~~~~

We expect you to follow the on-line datacamp courses for python and R. Follow
the schedule that we provide as we will check whether you finish these on-line
courses in time. If you do not, you get a "fail" for this.

Assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can do assignments alone or together with one other student from the same
tutorial group as yours. Make sure that you mention both student names and
student numbers in the first cell of the assignment notebook.



Grading:
~~~~~~~~

If you want to get a grade for this course, make sure you register in the google form before the deadline!

In the schedule there are 5 pass/fail items. For each "pass", you earn 0.5 points;
for a "fail" you earn 0 points. Hence, if you have 5 times a "pass", you earn
2.5 points for your final grade.

With the final assignment you can earn 8 points (4 for the python assignment and
4 for the R assignment). Yes, we know that 8 + 2.5 = 10.5; however, your grade
is 10.0 at max.

The final assignment, like the other assignments, you can do together with one other student from the same
tutorial group as yours.
