Markdown in the notebook
========================

We teach you to program python and R in the jupyter notebook. However, for other people to understand what you are doing, it is important that you explain each step in text that is readable to other human beings, even ones that have no programming experience. Consider yourself working for a consultancy firm after finishing your studies. Your boss asks you to solve a problem and you find a way to program the solution to this problem. To convince your boss that you found the correct solution, she needs to understand what you did --even if she cannot program in python or R herself.

For this we use markdown which is a simple "language" to typeset text. Using this language you can explain each step in your jupyter notebook.
