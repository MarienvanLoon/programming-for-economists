Github
======

We teach you to program in python and R and to explain your code using markdown. For us (and others) to see what you have done, you should publish the jupyter notebooks that you have worked on. For this course, we use github for you to publish your results.

Github is an extremely powerful tool as it allows for team collaboration and version control in the cloud. Further, it allows you to publish webpages in html. In fact, the documentation for this course is on github (as you can see in the html address).

However, you do not need to know all this for the purpose of this course. We will only use github for you to put your jupyter notebooks on line so that we can grade them.
