questions
---------

If you have questions/comments about this course, go to the `issues
page <https://github.com/janboone/open_source_for_economists/issues>`_
open a new issue (with the green "New issue" button) and type your
question. Use a title that is informative (e.g. not "question", but
"question about assignment 2"). Go to the next box ("Leave a comment")
and type your question. Then click on "Submit new issue". We will
answer your question as quickly as possible.

The advantages of the issue page include:

* if you have a question, other students may have it as well; in this
  way we answer the questions in a way that everyone can see it. Also
  before asking the question, you may want to check whether it was
  asked/answered before on the issue page
* we answer your question more quickly than when you email us
* you increase your knowledge of github!

Only when you need to include privately sensitive information ("my cat
has passed away"), you can send an email.

In order to post issues, you need to create a github account (which
you need anyway to follow this course).

Note that if your question is related to another issue, you can react
to the earlier issue and leave a comment in that "conversation".
