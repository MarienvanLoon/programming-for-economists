Schedule
========

This page gives the schedule for the course. Make sure that you
prepare for each week's lecture and/or tutorial the topics that are
mentioned for this week. To illustrate, for the first week, go to the
:ref:`install page <install>` and follow instructions there and go to
the `datacamp website
<https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science>`_
and go through chapter 1 Python Basics. That is, watch the videos and
do the exercises on line. Note that we get feedback from Datacamp on whether or
not you actually did the exercises and we will grade this using a Pass/Fail
grade (see below).

questions
---------

If you have questions/comments about this course, go to the `issues
page <https://github.com/janboone/programming-for-economists/issues>`_
open a new issue (with the green "New issue" button) and type your
question. Use a title that is informative (e.g. not "question", but
"question about assignment 2"). Go to the next box ("Leave a comment")
and type your question. Then click on "Submit new issue". We will
answer your question as quickly as possible.

Information that we need to answer your question:

* say whether you are an ECO or EBE student
* mention the group number of your tutorial and/or the name of your tutorial teacher
* explain your question

The advantages of the issue page include:

* if you have a question, other students may have it as well; in this
  way we answer the questions in a way that everyone can see it. Also
  before asking the question, you may want to check whether it was
  asked/answered before on the issue page
* we answer your question more quickly than when you email us
* you increase your knowledge of github!

Only when you need to include privately sensitive information ("my cat
has passed away"), you can send an email.

In order to post issues, you need to create a github account (which
you need anyway to follow this course).

Note that if your question is related to another issue, you can react
to the earlier issue and leave a comment in that "conversation".
