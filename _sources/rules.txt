Rules of the game
=================


Datacamp
~~~~~~~~

We expect you to follow the on-line datacamp courses for python and R. Follow
the schedule that we provide as we will check whether you finish these on-line
courses in time. If you do not, you get a "fail" for this.

Assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can do assignments alone or together with one other student from the same
tutorial group as yours. Make sure that you mention both student names and
student numbers in the first cell of the assignment notebook.

Grading:
~~~~~~~~

If you want to get a grade for this course, make sure you register in the google form before the deadline!

In the schedule there are 8 pass/fail items:

* 2 python assignments that need to be uploaded on github
* 2 datacamp deadlines for python courses
* 2 R assignments that need to be uploaded on github
* 2 datacamp deadlines for R courses

When you are enrolled in datacamp, you will see the dealines for the courses/chapters that you need to finish.

For the assignments: these need to be uploaded on github on the Monday of the week in which you have the tutorial. This applies to weeks 3,4,6 and 7.

Of the 4 assignments that you upload, we will grade 2 of these. We choose randomly which assignments to grade.

Hence, you earn 6 grades with datacamp and the assignments. For each pass you earn 1/3 points (and 0 for a fail). Hence, you can earn 2 points in total in the pass/fail grades.

If you fail all pass/fail grades, you cannot take the final exam.
  
With the :ref:`final assignment <finalassignment>` you can earn 8 points (4 for the python assignment and 4 for the R assignment).

The final assignment, like the other assignments, you can do together with one other student from the same tutorial group as yours.
