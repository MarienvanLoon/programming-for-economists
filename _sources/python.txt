* Assignment: :download:`this notebook <assignment2.ipynb>`

  * fill in the notebook
  * upload the notebook to github
  * add a link to this notebook in your README file on github

We work on this :download:`this notebook <week2.ipynb>`.


Learning markdown is easy. Simply google "markdown tutorial" or "markdown
cheatsheet". It is easy to practice in your jupyter notebook. Start a new
notebook, change the "type" of the first cell in the notebook from `code` to
`markdown`. There are two ways to do this:

* click on the dropdown menu at the top of the page which says `code` with small
  up and down arrows and change it to `markdown`
* when in the cell press "ESC", "m" and "ENTER"; this changes the cell into a
  markdown cell

Then type your markdown and press "SHIFT" + "ENTER" simultaneously; presto! this
is what it looks like.



Markdown in the notebook
========================

.. _markdown:

We teach you to program python and R in the jupyter notebook. However, for other
people to understand what you are doing, it is important that you explain each
step in text that is readable to other human beings, even ones that have no
programming experience. Consider yourself working for a consultancy firm after
finishing your studies. Your boss asks you to solve a problem and you find a way
to program the solution to this problem. To convince your boss that you found
the correct solution, she needs to understand what you did --even if she cannot
program in python or R herself. For this we use markdown which is a simple
"language" to typeset text. Using this language you can explain each step in
your jupyter notebook.

You need markdown to create a README file on your github page which contains the
links to your assignments. For an example of such a README file, see `this file
on github. <https://github.com/janboone/assignments/blob/master/README.md>`_
Click on the `Raw` button to see the markdown used to create the links.

For this example, the github link that you post in the google-form is this one: `<https://github.com/janboone/assignments>`_
When we click on this link, we immediately see your README file with the links
to your assignments. Note that for this course, there is no need to create a CV.
