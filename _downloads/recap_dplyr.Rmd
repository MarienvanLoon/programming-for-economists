# Recapitulation of dplyr

This is a very short recapitulation of `dplyr`. Both `tidyr` and `dplyr` are part of the package `tidyverse`. `ggplot2` is also part of the _tidyversum_ (for a complete list, [see here](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)). With `dplyr` you can manipulate dataframes.

## Package `dplyr`

In package `dplyr` there are 5 _verbs_ that are really important:

1. `mutate()` creates new variables based on existing variables 
2. `select()` selects variables (columns). `select` allows you to rename variables as well: 
  `select(new_name = existing_name)`
3. `filter()` selects observations (rows) based on a  logic test)
4. `summarise()` reduces certain groups in a single value
5. `arrange()` changes the order of the observations
