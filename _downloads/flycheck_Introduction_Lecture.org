* Introduction

** Don't panic

    - this is a programming course
    - we know that many of you are not too keen on computers (beyond MS Office)
    - this will be an introduction to open source software
    - it will not become too sophisticated
    - it is meant for everyone to understand
    - especially, if you never did any programming before


** Why this course?

    - mainly to teach you to use your computer better
    - to be able to use open source ("free") software
    - to solve problems together with readable documentation on how you solved
      it ("reproducible research")
    - on this last point, office products like excel score rather badly


** Who teaches this course?

    - In 2016-2017 this course is taught by:

        + Santiago Bohorquez Correa
        + Jan Boone
        + Clemens Fiedler
        + Misja Mikkers
        + Louis Raes
        + Minke Remmerswaal


** How do we teach this course?

    - on line lectures on Datacamp
    - lectures
    - tutorials: with plenty of time to ask questions
    - schedule can be found [[http://janboone.github.io/programming-for-economists/schedule.html][here]]
    - we track your progress on datacamp
    - assignments


** Information about the course

    - all information about the course can be found [[http://janboone.github.io/programming-for-economists/index.html][here]]

** Your grade

    - see [[http://janboone.github.io/programming-for-economists/rules.html][Rules of the Game]] to see how your grade is determined
    - it depends on:

        + your progress on Datacamp
        + assignments you do on your own or together with 1 other student (group
          of two, at max.)
        + 8 pass/fail grades
        + grade of your final assignment


** Something went wrong?

    - we asked you to [[http://janboone.github.io/programming-for-economists/install.html][install some software]]
    - perhaps something went wrong
    - at the end of this lecture, we will walk around to solve your problems
    - also during the tutorials you can ask questions about this

** Github and Datacamp

    - you need to sign up for github and Datacamp!
    - for details see [[http://janboone.github.io/programming-for-economists/index.html#important][the heading Important]]
    - note the *deadline* for filling in the webform!
    - if you miss the deadline, you will have to pay for premium content on
      Datacamp yourself


* Github

** What is github?

- github allows you to store files "in the cloud"
- unless you use a private repository, these files are public
- this is how we can see your assignments
- it allows you to do a lot more (version control, collaborate on line etc.)
- but we will not use this more advanced stuff for this course
- look [[http://janboone.github.io/programming-for-economists/github.html][here]] to see how to create a repository `assignments` in github and upload your
  assignment
-  video explaining how to create a link to each of your
  assignments in the README file of your repository

* markdown

** syntax

- markdown allows you to create structure in a simple way
- examples are:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    this is a heading
    =================

    subheading
    ----------

    * first bullet
    * second bullet

    [link text](actual link, e.g. http://www.etc)

    ![Alt text for image](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")
#+END_EXAMPLE

- look on the web for other syntax like footnotes etc.
- equations you can type in latex


** latex

- latex is great word processing software
- you should consider writing your thesis in latex
- but for now, we focus on writing math in latex
- you can guess what the following will do:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$x^2$, $\beta$, $\sqrt{9}$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $\bar x$

\begin{equation}

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

\end{equation}
#+END_EXAMPLE

- if you need something, just google; e.g. "google latex phi" or
  "google latex empty set" etc.

** markdown in jupyter notebook

    - if you have installed anaconda, you can start a jupyter notebook

        + by typing `jupyter notebook` in the command line/shell/terminal
        + using the anaconda launcher

    - let's look at [[http://janboone.github.io/programming-for-economists/_downloads/markdown_notebook.html][this markdown notebook]]
